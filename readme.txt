An WordPress implementation of the Slimbox2 javascript.

== Description ==

A WordPress implementation of the stellar Slimbox2 script by Christophe Beyls (an enhanced clone of the Lightbox script) which utilizes the jQuery library to create an impressive image overlay with slide-out effects.

Almost, if not all, options are configurable from the administration panel. For more on the settings and what they do check out the <a href="http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2/" title="Slimbox 2, the ultimate lightweight Lightbox clone for jQuery">Slimbox2</a> page.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete `WP-Slimbox2` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory<br />
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress<br />
3. Visit the "WP-Slimbox2" page in your WordPress options menu to configure any advanced settings.<br />
5. Manually add the <code>rel="lightbox"</code> attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox or <code>rel="lightbox-imagesetname"</code> for an image set, using the title attribute to store a caption. Alternatively you may use the autoload option to automatically prepare links to images and additionally enable picasaweb and flickr integration to easily utilize their albums.<br />

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Slimbox2 support the lightbox effect on pages and videos? =

No. As stated in the script creators FAQ, Slimbox was designed to display images only, to be simple and to have the smallest code. <br />

= What kind of grouping does autoload utilize? =
Autoload has been modified to group all images in a Wordpress post if the theme places posts inside a div with class="post". If the images are instead on a page they will all be grouped together. If you want individual group sets it is recommend you instead manually insert 'rel="lightbox-groupname"' inside your hyperlinks to specify your groups.

= Why do I need WordPress 2.8+? =

The Javascript requires jQuery 1.3+ which wasn't included in WordPress until 2.8. If you're using something to override the included jQuery with a newer version (a feature I may add at a later date) it should be compatible from 2.1+ since I believe that was when wp_enqueue_script() was implemented.<br />

= Why can't the plugin do X, Y or Z? =

Either the Javascript doesn't support it, or I haven't gotten around to adding it.<br />

= Why isn't the plugin in my language? Could I contribute a translation? =

I only know English, but as of v.0.9.4 the plugin supports localization using PO and MO files, just like WordPress.<br />
A copy of the POT file to use in your translations can be found in the languages directory as wp-slimbox2.pot.<br />
If you're willing to provide a translation I'd be more than happy to include it. The NEXT, PREV, and Close buttons can be translated as well.<br />
If you've translated the plugin or would like to find out more please let me know by posting on our <a href="http://pixopoint.com/forum/index.php?topic=1383.0">support forums</a>.<br />

= Why should I use this plugin? =

You want Lightbox or Slimbox effects using the jQuery library, and don't want any sort of "ad".<br />
You want complete control over all the javascript settings from the admin page.<br />

= What is Localization Tracking? =

To satisfy my own curiosity regarding how many people are using a non-English version of the plugin I've written a small script, statTrack.php. During activiation of the plugin it submits the localization of the WordPress install to my server for recording. It will only do this once, and no other information is transmitted. To disable it, you can safely delete statTrack.php and the plugin should function normally.<br />

= What if I have other questions that haven't been answered? =
